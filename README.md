#To Do List Web Application

This web application was made to help declutter your brain and maximize your productivity! This project was implemented
without a database. This is because React is a light weight framework that can use State functions to maintain a relatively
small database, which is perfect for a todo list!

### Set-Up 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Bootstrapping the project with create-react-app adds all the standard dependencies required to run a react app. 
These include, but are not limited to: 
  > Babel - for Javascript ES6 processing 
  > Webpack - for bundling and minifying files
  > Test Runners
  > Script Automation
  
##### To Run The Application 

In your commandline: 

Type `npm install` to install all the required dependencies that are specified in the packages.json file. 

Then `npm start` to run the local host server

navigate to `localhost:5000` and you should see the web application!
